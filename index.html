                Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Industrial Automation, IoT, Industry 4.0,
                Cryptography, and Blockchain have enhanced research activities globally.  At present
                relatively more research Scholars are pursuing Ph.D. research work in the reputed universities
                in this area compared to any other area of Engineering. There is a very high demand for jobs
                in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine learning, and Network security.
                The faculty members of Electronics, IT-related and Electrical branches are very keen to
                enhance their knowledge in the above emerging areas to cope up with the new technological
                developments. This International conference ICERECT will focus more research papers in
                the above areas from the researchers of Indian and foreign universities and from the
                industries. This conference will be highly useful for the faculty, students and researchers. </p>

          <p align="justify">
            The aim of the conference was to provide a platform to the researchers and practitioners from both academia as well as industry to meet and share cutting-edge development in the related field. The Conference looked for significant
            contributions to all major fields of the Electronics, Computer Science and Information Technology in theoretical and practical aspects. The Conference focused to provide an excellent international forum for sharing knowledge and results
            on
            the most recent and relevant research, theory, methodology and applications of Electronics, Computer Science Engineering and Applications.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We had invited a distinguished academician and an eminent researcher - Rangaraj M. Rangayyan, PhD, PEng, FIEEE, FEIC, FAIMBE, FSPIE, FSIIM, FCMBES, FCAE, "University Professor", Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer
            Engineering,

          <p align="justify">
            The chief guest Prof. D.K. Subramanian, Retd Professor of IISc, and also TEQIP Mentor of our college advised the research scholars to take up innovative experiments and perform meaningful research which will be useful for the society.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Dr. Rangayyan highlighted the importance of research and gave a thought provoking lecture on Retinopathy. This was followed by an invited talk by Dr.K.N.Bhanuprakash, Scientist ASTAR, and Singapore on Electronic Brain Atlas.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            On 22nd Dr.Rajkumar Vedam, Invensys, USA delivered a talk on Search Directions for Intelligence which exposed the various areas to take up the research. The sessions were held as per schedule. Nearly One hundred papers were presented by
            the
            research scholars. The Valedictory function was held on 22nd in which Sri. Sharan C Padashetty, Special Officer, TEQIP, DTE, Karnataka highlighted the financial assistance to various research activities.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The papers received from various research scholars and students in and around the globe were of good quality. We had received around 260 papers out of which we had selected 118 papers. All the selected papers were presented and the
            deliberations were more useful to the research scholars. A number of researchers from both academic institutions and industries had contributed their novel methods, algorithms, analysis techniques to solve various problems in the above
            field. The innovative ideas of young researchers of various institutions were brought to lime light by sharing them with others in this platform.

            Third International Conference on Emerging Research in Electronics, Computer Science and Technology was organized during 22nd to 24th August 2018 and has witnessed research papers from diverse area of Electronics, Computer Science and
            Information Technology covering important aspects in these areas. Theme is intentionally made generic to attract large number of researchers to a common discussion forum. Having rich experience in organizing International conferences over
            the years, ICERECT has developed into a well established conference bringing together academic scientists, professors, research scholars and students to share and disseminate information on knowledge and scientific research works related
            to
            Electronics, Computer Science and Information Technology.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the
                  conference (including its removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not
                  presented at the conference.</p>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <p>Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized
                  material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same
                  time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the
                  IEEE will take action against any author who engages in either practice.
                  Kindly follow these links for more details:<a style="color: tomato" href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism/plagiarism.html"> IEEE Policy on

                <p>Submitted papers must be unpublished and not currently under review for
                  any other publication. The authors of accepted papers will need to sign an
                  IEEE Copyright form and present their paper at the conference.</p>
