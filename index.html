              <h4 class="section-title" style = "color: #00B4D8;">About ICERECT-22</h4>
              <p align="justify">The proposed international conference is very much relevant now because, the present
                technological developments in the areas of computers, mobile, Digital Media, E-Commerce,
                Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Industrial Automation, IoT, Industry 4.0,
                Cryptography, and Blockchain have enhanced research activities globally.  At present
                relatively more research Scholars are pursuing Ph.D. research work in the reputed universities
                in this area compared to any other area of Engineering. There is a very high demand for jobs
                in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine learning, and Network security.
                The faculty members of Electronics, IT-related and Electrical branches are very keen to
                enhance their knowledge in the above emerging areas to cope up with the new technological
                developments. This International conference ICERECT will focus more research papers in
                the above areas from the researchers of Indian and foreign universities and from the
                industries. This conference will be highly useful for the faculty, students and researchers. </p>
